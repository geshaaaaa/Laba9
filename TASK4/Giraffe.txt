Hello what is your name?
Many young giraffes, called calves, die from lion attacks during their first year of life. 
Once a giraffe reaches adulthood its height is often enough to protect it from lions. 
Adult giraffes, however, must still be careful of lions when they are bending down to drink water or rest. Usually giraffes will drink or rest in shifts so that at least one giraffe is always on the lookout for approaching predators.â€‹
